A limited wish lets you create nearly any type of effect. A
limited wish can do any of the following:

    *   * Duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or
        lower, provided the spell is not from a school prohibited
        to you.
    *   * Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower,
        provided the spell is not from a school prohibited to
        you.
    *   * Duplicate any wizard/sorcerer spell of 5th level or
        lower even if it's from a prohibited school.
    *   * Duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower even if
        it's from a prohibited school.
    *   * Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as
        geas/quest or insanity.
    *   * Have any other effect whose power level is in line with
        the above effects, such as a single creature
        automatically hitting on its next attack or suffering a
        -7 penalty on its next saving throw.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance
as normal (but the save DC is for a 7th-level spell). When a
limited wish duplicates a spell that has an XP cost, you must pay
that cost or 300 XP, whichever is more. When a limited wish spell
duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than
1,000 gp, you must provide that component.
