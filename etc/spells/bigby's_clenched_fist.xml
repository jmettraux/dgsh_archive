   <string>As Bigby's interposing hand, except it moves and attacks as directed by you. (You direct it as a free action.) The floating hand can move up to 60 feet and can attack in the same round.  Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack invisible or concealed creatures is no better than yours.  The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively), +11 for the hand's Strength score (33), -1 for being Large. The hand's damage is 1d8+12, and any creature struck must make a Fortitude save (against this spell's save DC) or be stunned for 1 round. A stunned creature can't act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC.  Attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack it.</string>
