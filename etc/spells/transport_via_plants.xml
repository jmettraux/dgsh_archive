You can enter any normal plant (Medium-size or larger) and
pass any distance to a plant of the same species in a single
round, regardless of the distance separating the two. The entry
plant must be alive. The destination plant need not be familiar
to you, but it also must be alive. If you are uncertain of the
location of a particular kind of destination plant, you need
merely designate direction and distance ("an oak tree one
hundred miles due north of here"), and the transport via
plants spell moves you as close as possible to the desired
location. If a particular destination plant is desired (the oak
tree outside your druid grove, for instance), but the plant is
not living, the spell fails and you are ejected from the entry
plant.
This spell does not function with plant creatures such as
shambling mounds and treants.
The destruction of an occupied plant slays you.
