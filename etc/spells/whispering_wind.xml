You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot.
The whispering wind travels to a specific location within range
that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the
location. (It can't pass through walls, for instance.) The
whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it
reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message
or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of
whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.
You can prepare the spell to bear a message of up to twenty-five
words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or
merely have the whispering wind seem to be a faint stirring of
the air. You can likewise cause the whispering wind to move as
slowly as one mile per hour or as quickly as one mile per 10
minutes. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and
remains until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth,
whispering wind cannot speak verbal components, use command
words, or activate magical effects.
