   <string>Uttering dictum creates two effects.

If you are on your home plane, nonlawful extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes.  Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 1 day. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the dictum.

Creatures native to your plane who hear the dictum and are not lawful suffer the following ill effects:

HD             Effect
--             ------
12 or more     Deafened
Less than 12   Slowed, deafened
Less than 8    Paralyzed, slowed, deafened
Less than 4    Killed, paralyzed, slowed, deafened

The effects are cumulative.

Deafened: The creature is struck deaf (see blindness/deafness) for 1d4 rounds.

Slowed: The creature is slowed, as by the slow spell, for 2d4 rounds.

Paralyzed: The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes, unable to move or act in any way.

Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.</string>
