As polymorph other, except this spell enables you to assume
the form of any single creature of less than deity status
(including unique dragon types, or the like) or any single
object. The assumed form can be no smaller than a flea and no
larger than 200 feet in its largest dimension. Unlike polymorph
other, this spell allows incorporeal forms to be assumed.
Your new form works like a polymorph other form. You still do
not gain the supernatural or spell-like abilities of your new
form, though you do gain its extraordinary abilities while
keeping your own. You also gain the type of the new form (for
example, "dragon" or "magical beast") in
place of your own. The new form does not disorient you. Parts of
your body or pieces of equipment that are separated from you do
not revert to their original forms. Thus, a new form's
poison bite is effective.
You can become just about anything you are familiar with. You
can change form once each round as a free action. The change
takes place either immediately before your regular action or
immediately after it, but not during the action. 
If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get +10 on
your Disguise check.
