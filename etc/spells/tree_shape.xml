By means of this spell, you are able to assume the form of a
small, living tree or shrub or a large, dead tree trunk with a
small number of limbs. The closest inspection cannot reveal that
the tree in question is actually a magically concealed creature.
To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a
detect magic spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree.
While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around
you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points
and saves remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus
to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 1. You are immune
to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear
carried or worn changes with you.
You can dismiss tree shape as a free action.
