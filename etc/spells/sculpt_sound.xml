You change the sounds that creatures or objects make. You can
create sounds where none exist (such as making trees sing),
deaden sounds (such as making a party of adventurers silent), or
transform sounds into other sounds (such as making a
caster's voice sound like a pig snorting). All affected
creatures or objects must be transmuted in the same way. Once the
transmutation is made, you cannot change it.
You can change the qualities of sounds but cannot create words
with which you are unfamiliar yourself. For instance, you
can't change your voice so that it sounds as though you are
giving the command word to activate a magic item unless you know
that command word.
A spellcaster whose voice is changed dramatically (such as
into that of the aforementioned snorting pig) is unable to cast
spells with verbal components.
