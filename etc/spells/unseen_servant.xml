The unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force
that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch
things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and
mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it
repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so,
thus allowing you to command the servant to clean the floor and
then turn your attention elsewhere as long as you remain within
range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, etc. It has
an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or
drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert
only 20 pounds of force, and that is not enough to activate
certain pressure plates and other devices. Its speed is 15 feet.
The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an
attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6
points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against
attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell's range
(measured from your current position), the servant ceases to
exist.
