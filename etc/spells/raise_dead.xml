The cleric restores life to a deceased creature. The cleric
can raise creatures who have been dead only up to 1 day per
caster level. In addition, the subject's soul must be free
and willing to return. If the subject's soul is not willing
to return, the spell does not work; therefore, subjects who want
to return receive no saving throw. The subject loses a level (or
1 Constitution point, if she's 1st level) when raised.
Raise dead cures hit point damage up to a total of 1 hit point
per Hit Die. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1.
Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of
raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not
undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal
damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must
be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the
creature is brought back to life. None of the dead
creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way
by this spell.
A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or
killed by a death effect can't be raised by this spell.
Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures
can't be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature who
has died of old age.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the
spell loses one level when it is raised, just as if it had lost a
level to an energy-draining creature. This level loss cannot be
repaired by any spell. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 1
point of Constitution instead. A character who died with spells
prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being
raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A
character with spellcasting capacity (such as a sorcerer) has a
50% chance of losing any given spell slot, in addition to losing
spell slots for losing a level.
