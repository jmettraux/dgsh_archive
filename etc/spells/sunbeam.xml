For the duration of this spell, you can use a standard action
to evoke a dazzling beam of intensely hot light each round. You
can call forth one beam per three caster levels (maximum six
beams at 18th level). The spell ends when its duration runs out
or your allotment of beams is exhausted.
All creatures in the beam are blinded and take 3d6 points of
damage. (A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and
reduces the damage by half.) In addition to the obvious effects,
a blinded creature suffers a 50% miss chance in combat (all
opponents have full concealment), loses any Dexterity bonus to
AC, grants a +2 bonus to attackers' attack rolls (they are
effectively invisible), moves at half speed, and suffers a
-4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skills.
Creatures to whom sunlight is harmful or unnatural take double
damage.
Undead creatures caught within the ray are dealt 1d6 points of
damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), or half damage if a
Reflex save is successful. In addition, the ray results in the
destruction of undead creatures specifically affected by sunlight
if they fail their saves.
The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to
fungi, mold, oozes, slimes, jellies, puddings, and fungoid
creatures just as if they were undead creatures.
