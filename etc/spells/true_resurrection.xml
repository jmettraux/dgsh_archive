As raise dead, except the cleric can resurrect a creature who
has been dead up to 10 years per caster level. This spell can
even bring back creatures whose bodies have been wholly
destroyed, provided you unambiguously identify the deceased in
some fashion (reciting the deceased's time and place of
birth or death is the most common method).
Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately
restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of
level (or Constitution point) or prepared spells.
You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who
has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed.
Even true resurrection can't restore to life a creature
who has died of old age.
