   <string>
A melee weapon made of pure force springs into existence and
attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8
damage per hit. The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by
your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or
symbolism to you and has the same threat range and critical
multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent
you designate, starting with one attack the round the spell is
cast and continuing each round thereafter. It uses your base
attack bonus as its attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple
attacks per round in subsequent rounds). It strikes as a spell,
not as a weapon, so, for example, it can strike incorporeal
creatures. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does
not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats
(such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not
affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if
it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the
weapon returns to you and hovers.
Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to
switch the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon
continues to attack the previous round's target. On any
round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack.
Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to
make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it
to. The spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or damaged.
If an attacked creature has SR, the resistance is checked the
first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is
successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon
has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of
the spell.
