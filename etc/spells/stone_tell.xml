You gain the ability to speak with stones, which relate to you
who or what has touched them as well as revealing what is covered
or concealed behind or under them. The stones relate complete
descriptions if asked. Note that a stone's perspective,
perception, and knowledge may prevent the stone from providing
the details you are looking for (as determined by the DM). You
can speak with natural or worked stone.
