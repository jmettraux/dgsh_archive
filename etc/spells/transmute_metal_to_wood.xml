This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its
area to wood. Weapons, armor, and other metal objects carried by
creatures are affected as well. Magic objects made of metal
effectively have SR 20 + caster level against this spell.
Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from metal to
wood suffer a -2 penalty to attack and damage rolls. Armor
converted from metal to wood loses 2 points of AC bonus. Weapons
changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack
roll of 1 or 2, and armor changed by this spell loses an
additional point of AC bonus every time it is struck by a natural
attack roll of 19 or 20.
Only a limited wish, miracle, or wish or similar magic can
restore a transmuted object to its metallic state. Otherwise, for
example, a metal door changed to wood is forevermore a wooden
door.
