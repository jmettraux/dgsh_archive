This spell causes instant diminution of a creature or object,
decreasing its size and weight. Its height shrinks by up to 10%
per caster level, to a maximum reduction of 50%. The reduced
weight is proportional to the cube of the new height, as follows:
Height Decrease    Weight Decrease
---------------    ---------------
-10% (x 0.9)     -30% (x 0.7)
-20% (x 0.8)     -50% (x 0.5)
-30% (x 0.7)     -60% (x 0.4)
-40% (x 0.6)     -80% (x 0.2)
-50% (x 0.5)     -90% (x 0.1)
All equipment worn or carried by a creature is reduced by the
spell. Magical properties are not decreased by this spell---a
smaller +3 sword is still +3, a smaller wand is still capable of
its normal functions, and a smaller dose of a potion still has
its normal effects. Weight, mass, and strength are affected,
though. Thus, a hurled stone would have less mass (and cause less
damage), chains would be easier to burst, a rope made thinner and
easier to sever, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor
Class, and attack rolls do not change, but Strength decreases
with size. For every 10% of reduction, a creature's Strength
score suffers an enlargement penalty of -1, to a minimum
score of 1.
A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed to it,
but a reduced object shrinks only as long as the object itself is
not damaged.
Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack.
Reduce counters and dispels enlarge.
