   <string>This spell enables you to make a snare that functions as a magic trap. The snare can be made from any supple vine, a thong, or a rope. When you cast snare upon it, the cordlike object blends with its surroundings (DC 23 Search check for a rogue [only] to locate). One end of the snare is tied in a loop that contracts around one or more of the limbs of any creature stepping inside the circle. (Note that the head of a worm or a snake could be thus ensnared.)

If a strong and supple tree is nearby, the snare can be fastened to it. The spell causes the tree to bend and then straighten when the loop is triggered, dealing 1d6 points of damage to the creature trapped and lifting it off the ground by the trapped limb or limbs. If no such tree is available, the cordlike object tightens around the creature, causing no damage but tightly binding it.

An entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls and suffers a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity. If the snare is anchored to an immobile object, the entangled character cannot move. Otherwise, he can move at half speed, but can't run or charge. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by this spell must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 15) to cast a spell.

The snare is magical. To escape, the trapped creature must succeed at an Escape Artist check (DC 23) or a Strength check (DC 23) that is a full-round action. The snare has 5 hit points and AC 7. A successful escape from the snare breaks the loop and ends the spell.</string>
