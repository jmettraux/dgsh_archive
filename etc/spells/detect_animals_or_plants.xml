  <void property="longDescription"> 
   <string>You can detect a particular type of animal or plant in a quarter circle emanating out from you in whatever direction you face. You must think of a species of animal or plant when using the spell. Each round you can change the animal or plant type.  The amount of information revealed depends on how long you search a particular area or focus on a specific type of animal or plant:

1st Round: Presence or absence of the animal or plant type in that quarter.

2nd Round: Number of individuals of the specified type in the area, and the condition of the healthiest specimen.

3rd Round: The condition and location of each individual present. If an animal or plant is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

Conditions: For purposes of this spell, the categories of condition are as follows:

Normal: Has at least 90% of original hit points, free of disease.
Fair: 30% to 90% of original hit points remaining.
Poor: Up to 30% of original hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease, or suffering from a debilitating injury.
Weak: 0 or fewer hit points remaining, afflicted with a disease in the terminal stage, or crippled.

If a creature falls into more than one category, the spell indicates the weaker of the two.

Note: Each round you can turn to detect things in a new area.

The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.  The DM decides if a specific type of animal or plant is present.</string>
