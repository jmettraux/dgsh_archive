   <string>Bigby's interposing hand creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing nine-tenths cover (+10 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand-it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt to hide or disguise himself. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.

A Bigby's hand is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you when undamaged, and its AC is 20 (-1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don't cause damage do not affect it. The hand cannot push through a wall of force or enter an antimagic field. It suffers the full effects of a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The hand makes saving throws as its caster. Disintegrate or a successful dispel magic destroys the hand.

Any creature weighing less than 2,000 pounds trying to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. If the opponent weighs more than 2,000 pounds, the hand cannot reduce its speed but still affects the opponent's attacks.

By concentrating (as a standard action), you can designate a new opponent for the hand.</string>
