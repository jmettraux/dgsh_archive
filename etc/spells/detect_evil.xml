   <string>You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject:

1st Round: Presence or absence of evil.

2nd Round: Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the strength of the strongest evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, the strongest evil aura's strength is "overwhelming" (see below), and the strength is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. While you are stunned, you can't act, you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, and attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack you.

3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

Aura Strength: An aura's evil power and strength depend on the type of evil creature or object that you're detecting and its HD, caster level, or (in the case of a cleric) class level.


Creature/Object    Evil Power
---------------    ----------
Evil creature      HD / 5
Undead creature    HD / 2
Evil elemental     HD / 2
Evil magic item 
or spell           Caster level / 2
Evil outsider      HD
Cleric of an 
evil deity         Level


Evil Power    Aura Strength
----------    -------------
Lingering     Dim
1 or less     Faint
2-4           Moderate
5-10          Strong
11+           Overwhelming

If an aura falls into more than one strength category, the spell indicates the stronger of the two.

Length Aura Lingers: How long the aura lingers depends on its original strength:

Original Strength    Duration
-----------------    --------
Faint                1d6 minutes
Moderate             1d6 X 10 minutes
Strong               1d6 hours
Overwhelming         1d6 days

Remember that animals, traps, poisons, and other potential perils are not evil; this spell does not detect them.  Note: Each round, you can turn to detect things in a new area.  The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.</string>
