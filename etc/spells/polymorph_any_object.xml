As polymorph other, except this spell changes one object or
creature into another. The duration of the spell depends on how
radical a change is made from the original state to its enchanted
state. The DM determines the duration by using the following
guidelines:
                            Increase to
Changed Subject Is:                     Duration Factor*
-------------------                     ----------------
Same kingdom (animal, vegetable, mineral)         +5
Same class (mammals, fungi, metals, etc.)         +2
Same size                         +2
Related (twig is to tree, wolf fur is to wolf, etc.)     +2
Same or lower Intelligence                 +2
*Add all that apply. Look up the total on the next table.
Duration
Factor         Example            Duration
--------    -------            --------
0         Pebble to human     20 minutes
2         Marionette to human     1 hour
4         Human to marionette     3 hours
5         Lizard to manticore     12 hours
6         Sheep to wool coat     2 days
7         Shrew to manticore     1 week
9+         Manticore to shrew     Permanent
Unlike polymorph other, polymorph any object does grant the
creature the Intelligence score of its new form. If the original
form didn't have a Wisdom or Charisma score, it gains those
scores of the new form.
As with other polymorph spells, damage sustained in the new
form can result in the injury or death of the polymorphed
creature. In general, damage occurs when the new form is changed
through physical force, although the DM will have to adjudicate
many of these situations.
Also note that a polymorph effect often detracts from an
item's or creature's powers but does not add new powers
except perhaps movement capabilities not present in the old form.
A nonmagical object cannot be made magical by this spell. A magic
item or weapon or other object can be polymorphed into another
type of magic object, but it never gains abilities superior to
those of the original object.
This spell cannot create material of great intrinsic value,
such as copper, silver, gems, silk, gold, and platinum.
This spell can also be used to duplicate the effects of
polymorph other, flesh to stone, stone to flesh, transmute mud to
rock, transmute water to dust, or transmute rock to mud.
