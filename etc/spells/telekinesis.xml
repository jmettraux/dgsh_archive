You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them.
Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide either a
gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust.
Sustained Force: A sustained force moves a creature or object
weighing up to 25 pounds per caster level up to 20 feet per
round. A creature can negate the effect against itself or against
an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with SR.
This version of the spell lasts up to 1 round per caster
level, but it ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be
moved vertically, horizontally, or both. An object cannot be
moved beyond your range. The spell ends if the object is forced
beyond the range. If you cease concentration for any reason, the
object falls or stops.
An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one
hand. For example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be
turned, an object rotated, and so on, if the force required is
within the weight limitation. You might even be able to untie
simple knots, though delicate activities such as these require
Intelligence checks against a DC set by the DM.
Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be
expended in a single round. You can hurl one or more objects or
creatures who are within range and all within 10 feet of each
other toward any target within 10 feet/level of all the objects.
You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level.
You must succeed at attack rolls (one per creature or object
thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack
bonus + your Intelligence modifier. Weapons cause standard damage
(with no Strength bonus). Other objects cause damage ranging from
1 point per 25 pounds (for less dangerous objects such as a
barrel) to 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds (for hard, dense
objects such as a boulder).
Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can
be hurled, but they are allowed Will saves to negate the effect,
as are those whose held possessions are targeted by the spell. If
a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface, it
takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).
