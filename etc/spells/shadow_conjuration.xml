   <string>You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration spell of 3rd level or lower. Shadow conjurations are actually one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength.

All those that interact with the conjured object, force, or creature can make Will saves to recognize its shadowy nature.

Those who succeed do so.

Attack spells, such as flame arrow, have normal effects unless those affected succeed at Will saves. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur.  Mimicked spells allow the normal saves and SR.  

Shadow objects or substances, such as obscuring mists, have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they are one-fifth strength or 20% likely to work.

For instance, a shadow obscuring mist only provides one-half concealment at 25 feet, not 5 feet.

Shadow creatures have one-fifth the normal hit points (regardless of whether they're recognized as shadowy). They deal normal damage and have all normal abilities and weaknesses.

Against a creature who recognizes them as shadowy, however, such a creature's damage is one-fifth normal, and all special abilities that do not produce normal damage (in hit points) are only 20% likely to work. (Roll for each use and each affected character separately.) Furthermore, the shadow creature's AC bonuses are one-fifth as large (so a +7 total bonus resulting in AC 17 would change to a +1 total bonus for a new AC of 11).

Those who succeed at their saves see the shadow conjurations as transparent images superimposed on vague, shadowy forms.</string>
