  <void property="longDescription"> 
   <string>Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands.  These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points---floor and ceiling, opposite walls, etc.---or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web or simply touching its strands become entangled among the gluey fibers.

An entangled creature suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls, suffers a -4 penalty to effective Dexterity, and can't move. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15) or lose the spell.  Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not stuck in the webs and is free to act, though moving may be a problem (see below). If the save fails, the creature is stuck. A stuck creature can break loose by spending 1 round and succeeding at a Strength check (DC 20) or an Escape Artist check (DC 25).  Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature may progress through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check.

The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.

The web provides one-quarter cover for every 5 feet of the substance between you and an opponent---one-half cover for 10 feet of web, three-quarters for 15 feet, and total cover for 20 feet or more.

The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire---a torch, burning oil, a flaming sword, etc.---can set them alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of damage from the flames.</string>
