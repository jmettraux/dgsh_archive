   <string>Chill metal makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Enchanted metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw (unless its own is higher).  A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected or if it's holding, touching, wearing, or carrying metal weighing one-fifth of its weight. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it's not wearing metal armor and the metal that it's carrying weighs less than one-fifth of its weight.

On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes very chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage (this is also the effect on the last round of the spell's duration). During the second (and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, causing more damage, as shown below:

Round     Temperature Damage
-----     ----------- ------
1         Cold        None
2         Icy         1d4 points
3-5       Freezing    2d4 points
6         Icy         1d4 points
7         Cold        None

Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a chill metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the creature plunges through a wall of fire in the same round and takes 8 points of fire damage, it winds up taking no chill damage and only 3 points of fire damage. Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it more buoyant.
