   <string>Word of recall teleports you instantly back to your sanctuary when the word is uttered. You must designate the sanctuary when you prepare the spell, and it must be a very familiar place. The actual point of arrival is a designated area no larger than 10 feet by 10 feet. You can be transported any distance within a plane but cannot travel between planes. You can transport, in addition to yourself, objects and creatures weighing up to 50 pounds per caster level. Thus, a 15th-level cleric could transport his person and objects or creatures weighing an additional 750 pounds. Exceeding this limit causes the spell to fail.

An unwilling creature can't be teleported by word of recall. Likewise, a creature's Will save (or SR) prevents items in its possession from being teleported. Unattended, nonmagical objects receive no saving throw.</string>
