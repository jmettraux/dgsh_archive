   <string>An augury can tell you whether a particular action will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future.  The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70% + 1% per caster level; the DM makes the roll secretly. The DM may determine that the question is so straightforward that a successful result is automatic, or so vague as to have no chance of success. If the augury succeeds, you get one of four results:

If the spell fails, you get the "nothing" result. A cleric who gets the "nothing" result has no way to tell whether it resulted from a failed or successful augury.  The augury can see into the future only about half an hour, so anything that might happen after that does not affect the augury.  Thus, it might miss the long-term consequences of the contemplated action. All auguries cast by the same person about the same topic within half an hour use the same dice result as the first augury.</string>
