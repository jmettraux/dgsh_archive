Shield creates an invisible, mobile disk of force that hovers
in front of you. It negates magic missile attacks directed at
you. The disk also intercepts attacks, providing three-quarters
cover (+7 AC and +3 on Reflex saves against attacks that affect
an area). The disk moves out of the way when you attack, so it
does not provide cover to opponents. The disk protects you only
against magic missiles and attacks from one direction. You
designate half the battlefield (with yourself on the dividing
line) as being blocked by the shield. The other half is not. You
can change the defensive direction of the shield (that is, rotate
the dividing line) once as a free action on each of your turns.
