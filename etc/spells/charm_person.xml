   <string>This charm makes a humanoid of Medium-size or smaller regard you as his trusted friend and ally. If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, he receives a +5 bonus on his saving throw.

The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if he were an automaton, but he perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince him to do anything he wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries not allowed.) A charmed person never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the spell. Note also that you must speak the person's language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.</string>
