You create an unmoving, opaque sphere of force of any color
you desire around yourself. Half of the sphere projects above the
ground, and the lower hemisphere passes through the ground. Up to
nine other Medium-size creatures can fit into the field with you;
they can freely pass into and out of the hut without harming it.
However, if you remove yourself from the hut, the spell ends.
The temperature inside the hut is 70 dg F if the exterior
temperature is between 0 dg and 100 dg F. An exterior temperature
below 0 dg or above 100 dg lowers or raises, respectively, the
interior temperature on a 1-degree-for-1 basis (thus, if
it's -20 dg outside, inside it'll be 50 dg The hut
also provides protection against the elements, such as rain,
dust, and sandstorms. The hut withstands any wind of less than
hurricane force, but a hurricane (75+ mph wind speed) or greater
force destroys it.
The interior of the hut is a hemisphere. You can illuminate it
dimly upon command or extinguish the light as desired. Note that
although the force field is opaque from the outside, it is
transparent from within. Missiles, weapons, and most spell
effects can pass through the hut without affecting it, although
the occupants cannot be seen from outside the hut (they have
total concealment).
