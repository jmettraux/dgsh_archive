   <string>As fireball, except this spell is more powerful and can detonate up to 5 rounds after the spell is cast. The burst of flame detonates with a low roar and delivers 1d8 points of fire damage per caster level.
The glowing bead created by the spell can detonate immediately if you desire, or you can choose to delay the burst for up to 5 rounds. You choose the amount of delay upon completing the spell, and the delay cannot change once it has been set (unless someone touches the bead; see below). If you choose a delay, the glowing bead sits at its destination until it detonates. A creature can pick up and hurl the bead as a thrown weapon (range increment 10 feet). If a creature handles and moves the bead within 1 round of its detonation, there is a 25% chance that the bead detonates while the creature is handling it.</string>
