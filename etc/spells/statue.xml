   <string>A statue spell turns the subject to solid stone, along with any garments and equipment worn or carried. The initial transformation from flesh to stone requires 1 full round after the spell is cast. In statue form, the subject gains hardness 8.

The subject retains its own hit points.

The subject can see, hear, and smell normally, but does not need to eat or breathe. Feeling is limited to those sensations that can affect the granite-hard substance of the individual's body. Chipping is equal to a mere scratch, but breaking off one of the statue's arms is serious damage.  

The individual under the magic of a statue spell can return to his normal state, act, and then return instantly to the statue state (a free action) if he so desires, as long as the spell duration is in effect.</string>
