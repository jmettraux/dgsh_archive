You alter the substance of your body to a cloudlike vapor and
move through the air, possibly at great speed. You can take other
creatures with you, each of which acts independently.
A magical wind wafts a wind walker along at up to 600 feet per
round (60 mph) or as slow as 5 feet per round (1/2 mph), as the
walker wills. Wind walkers are not invisible but rather appear
misty and translucent. If fully clothed in white, they are 80%
likely to be mistaken for clouds, fog, vapors, etc.
A wind walker can regain her physical form as desired and
later resume the cloud form. Each change to and from vaporous
form requires 5 rounds. You, however, may dismiss the spell,
ending it immediately. You may even dismiss it for individual
wind walkers and not others. While in vaporous form, subjects
gain damage reduction 20/+1, though they may sustain damage from
high winds (as determined by the DM). No spellcasting is possible
in vaporous form.
For the last minute of the spell, a wind walker automatically
descends 60 feet per round (for a total of 600 feet), though she
may descend faster if she wishes. This descent serves as a
warning that the spell is about to end.
