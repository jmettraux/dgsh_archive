The warded creature gains partial protection from undead
creatures who use negative energy and certain weapons and spells
that drain energy levels. The negative energy protection spell
uses positive energy, which can offset the effects of a negative
energy attack. Each time the warded creature is struck by a
negative energy attack that drains levels or ability scores, it
rolls 1d20 + caster level against a DC of 11 + the
attacker's HD.
If the warded creature succeeds, the energies cancel with a
bright flash of light and a thunderclap. The warded creature
takes only hit point damage from the attack and does not suffer
any drain of experience levels or ability scores, regardless of
the number of levels or ability score points the attack would
have drained. An attacking undead creature takes 2d6 points of
damage from the positive energy. An attacking caster or weapon
receives no damage.
If the warded creature does not succeed, the negative energy
attack deals its normal damage. An attacking undead creature in
such a situation does not take any positive energy damage.
