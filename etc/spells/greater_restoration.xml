   <string>As lesser restoration, except the spell dispels all negative energy levels afflicting the healed creature, restoring the creature to the highest level it had previously achieved. This reverses level drains by a force or creature. The drained levels are restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is no more than 1 week per caster level.
Greater restoration also dispels all magical effects penalizing the character's abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points permanently drained from all ability scores. It also removes all forms of insanity, confusion, and similar mental effects. Greater restoration does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.</string>
