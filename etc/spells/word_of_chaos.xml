   <string>Uttering word of chaos creates two effects:

If you are on your home plane, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 1 day. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the word of chaos.

Creatures native to your plane who hear the word of chaos and are not chaotic suffer the following ill effects:

HD             Effect
--             ------
12 or more     Deafened
Less than 12   Stunned, deafened
Less than 8    Confused, stunned, deafened
Less than 4    Killed, confused, stunned, deafened

The effects are cumulative.

Deafened: The creature is struck deaf (see blindness/deafness) for 1d4 rounds.

Stunned: The creature is stunned for 1 round. A stunned creature can't act and loses any Dexterity bonus to AC.  Attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack it.

Confused: The creature is confused, as by the confusion spell, for 1d10 minutes. This is a mind-affecting enchantment.

Killed: Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed.</string>
