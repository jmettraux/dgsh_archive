As raise dead, except you are able to restore life and
complete strength to any deceased creature. The condition of the
remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the
creature's body still exists, it can be resurrected, but the
portion receiving the spell must have been part of the
creature's body at the time of death. (The remains of a
creature hit by a disintegrate spell count as a small portion of
its body.) The creature can have been dead no longer than 10
years per caster level.
Upon completion of the spell, the creature is immediately
restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of
prepared spells. However, the subject loses one level (or 1 point
of Constitution if the subject was 1st level).
You can revive someone killed by a death effect or someone who
has been turned into an undead creature and then destroyed. You
cannot revive someone who has died of old age.
