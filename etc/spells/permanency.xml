   <string>This spell makes certain other spells permanent. Depending on the spell, you must be at least a minimum level and must expend a number of XP.

You can make these spells permanent in regard to yourself:

                          Minimum 
Spell                     Level         XP Cost
-----                     -------       -------
Comprehend languages       9th            500 XP

Tongues                   11th          1,500 XP

You cast the desired spell and then follow it with the permanency spell. You cannot cast these spells on other creatures. This application of permanency can be dispelled only by a caster of greater level than you were when you cast the spell.

In addition to personal use, permanency can be used to make the following spells permanent on yourself, another creature, or an object (as appropriate):

              Minimum 
Spell         Level       XP Cost
-----         -------     -------
Enlarge       9th         500 XP
Magic Fang    9th         500 XP
Resistance    9th         250 XP

Additionally, the following spells can be cast upon objects or areas only and rendered permanent:

                       Minimum 
Spell                  Level       XP Cost
-----                  -------     -------

Spells cast on other creatures, objects, or locations (not on you) are vulnerable to dispel magic as normal.

The DM may allow other selected spells to be made permanent.  Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much time and money as independently researching the selected spell.

If the DM has already determined that the application is not possible, the research automatically fails. Note that you never learn what is possible except by the success or failure of your research.</string>
