This spell wards the subject and creates a mystic connection
between you and the subject so that some of the subject's
wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 deflection
bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus to saves. Additionally, the
subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks
(including those inflicted by special abilities) that deal it hit
point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded
creature is taken by you. Forms of harm that do not involve hit
points, such as charm effects, temporary ability damage, level
draining, and disintegration, are not affected. If the subject
suffers a reduction of hit points from a lowered Constitution
score, the reduction is not split with you because it is not hit
point damage. When the spell ends, subsequent damage is no longer
divided between the subject and you, but damage already split is
not reassigned to the subject.
If you and the subject of the spell move out of range of each
other, the spell ends.
