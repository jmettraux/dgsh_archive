   <string>You bring forth a great feast, including a magnificent table, chairs, service, and food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume, and the beneficial effects do not set in until this hour is over. Those partaking of the feast are cured of all diseases, are immune to poison for 12 hours, and are healed of 1d4+4 points of damage after imbibing the nectarlike beverage that is part of the feast. The ambrosial food that is consumed creates an effect equal to bless that lasts for 12 hours. During this same period, the people who consumed the feast are immune to magical fear and hopelessness.

If the feast is interrupted for any reason, the spell is ruined and all effects of the spell are negated.</string>
