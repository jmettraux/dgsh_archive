   <string>The creatures or objects affected fall slowly (though faster than feathers typically do). The rate of falling is instantly changed to a mere 60 feet a round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), with no damage incurred upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration ceases, a normal rate of fall resumes.

The character can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save herself if she unexpectedly falls. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round.

This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, such as a boulder dropped from the top of a castle wall, the item does half normal damage based on weight with no bonus for the height of the drop.

The spell works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.</string>
