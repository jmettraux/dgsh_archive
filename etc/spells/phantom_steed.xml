   <string>
You conjure a quasi-real, horselike creature. The steed can be
ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically
created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body,
gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that
make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle.
It does not fight, but all normal animals shun it and refuse to
attack it. (Dire animals and nonintelligent creatures, such as
vermin, can attack it.)
The mount has an Armor Class of 18 (-1 size, +4 natural
armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If
it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A
phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a
maximum of 240 feet. It can bear its rider's weight plus up
to 10 pounds per caster level.
These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A
mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster
levels. Thus, the mount created by a 12th-level caster has the
8th, 10th, and 12th caster level abilities.
8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even
swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.
10th Level: The mount can ride over water as if it were firm,
dry ground.
12th Level: The mount can ride in the air as if it were firm
land, so chasms and the like can be crossed without benefit of a
bridge. The mount cannot simply take off and fly. It can only
ride horizontally across the air. After 1 round in the air, the
mount falls.
14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed. It has a
maneuverability rating of average.
