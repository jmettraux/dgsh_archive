Rocky ground, stone floors, and similar surfaces shapes
themselves into long, sharp points that blend into the
background. The spike stones impede progress through an area and
deal damage. Any creature moving on foot into or through the
spell's area takes 1d8 points of damage for each 5 feet of
movement through the spiked area. In addition, ground speed
through the spell's area is reduced by half.
Any creature who sustains damage from this spell must also
succeed at a Reflex save or suffer injuries to its feet and legs
that slow its speed by one-third. This movement penalty lasts for
24 hours or until the injured creature receives a cure spell
(which also restores lost hit points). Another character can
remove the penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the injuries and
succeeding at a Heal check against the spell's save DC.
Spike stones is a magic trap that can't be disabled with
the Disable Device skill.
