Wish is the mightiest spell a wizard or sorcerer can cast. By
simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you.
Even wish, however, has its limits.
A wish can do any one of the following:

    *   Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level or
        lower, provided the spell is not from a school prohibited
        to you.
    *   Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower, provided
        the spell is not from a school prohibited to you.
    *   Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level or
        lower even if it's from a prohibited school.
    *   Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even if
        it's from a prohibited school.
    *   Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such as
        geas/quest or insanity.
    *   Create a valuable item, even a magic item, of up to
        15,000 gp in value.
    *   Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability score.
        Two to five wish spells cast in immediate succession can
        grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability
        score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3
        inherent bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are
        instantaneous, so they cannot be dispelled. Note: An
        inherent bonus may not exceed +5 for a single ability
        score, and inherent bonuses to a particular ability score
        do not stack, so only the best one applies.
    *   Remove injuries and afflictions. A single wish can aid
        one creature per caster level, and all subjects must be
        cured of the same type of affliction. For example, you
        could heal all the damage your party has suffered, or
        remove all the poison effects from the party, but not do
        both with the same wish. A wish can never restore the
        experience point loss from casting a spell or the level
        or Constitution loss from being raised from the dead.
    *   Revive the dead. A wish can bring a dead creature back to
        life by duplicating a resurrection spell. A wish can
        revive a dead creature whose body has been destroyed, but
        the feat takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and
        another to infuse the body with life again. A wish cannot
        prevent a character who was brought back to life from
        losing an experience level.
    *   Transport travelers. A wish can lift one creature per
        caster level from anywhere on any plane and place these
        creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local
        conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to
        negate and SR.
    *   Undo misfortune. A wish can undo a single recent event.
        The wish forces a reroll of any roll made within the last
        round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself
        to accommodate the new result. For example, the wish
        could undo an opponent's successful save, a
        foe's successful critical hit (either the attack
        roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed save,
        and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse
        than the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will
        save to negate and SR.

You may wish for greater effects than these, but doing so is
dangerous. Such a wish gives you the opportunity to fulfill your
request without fulfilling it completely. (The wish may pervert
your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or only a
partial fulfillment.)
Duplicated spells allow saves and SR as normal (but save DCs
are for 9th-level spells). When a wish duplicates a spell that
has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is
more. When a wish duplicates a spell with a material component
that costs more than 10,000 gp, you must provide that component.
