  <void property="longDescription"> 
   <string>This spell allows you to channel holy power into your sword, or any weapon you choose. The weapon acts as a +5 magic weapon and deals double damage against evil opponents. It emits a magic circle against evil (as the spell). If the magic circle ends, the sword creates a new one on your turn as a free action. The spell is automatically canceled 1 round after the weapon leaves your hand for any reason. You cannot have more than one holy sword at a time.
If this spell is cast on a magic weapon, the powers of the spell supersede any that the weapon normally has, rendering the normal enhancement bonus and powers of the weapon inoperative for the duration of the spell. This spell is not cumulative with bless weapon or any other spell that might modify the weapon in any way.
This spell does not work on artifacts.
Note: A masterwork weapon's bonus to attack does not stack with an enhancement bonus to attack.</string>
