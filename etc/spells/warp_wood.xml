You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its
straightness, form, and strength. At 1st level, you can warp a
handaxe handle or ten crossbow bolts. At 3rd level, you can warp
the shaft of a typical shortspear. Boards or planks can also be
affected, causing a door to be sprung or a boat or ship to leak.
Warped ranged weapons are useless. Warped melee weapons suffer a
-4 penalty to their attack rolls.
Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it
back to normal) with this spell, straightening wood that has been
warped by this spell or by other means. Make whole, on the other
hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.
