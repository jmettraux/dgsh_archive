This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but
you. In fact, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures
seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their
normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent
time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and the like can still
harm you. While the time stop is in effect, other creatures are
invulnerable to your attacks and spells; however, you can create
spell effects and leave them to take effect when the time stop
spell ends. (The spells' durations do not begin until the
time stop is over.)
You cannot move or harm items held, carried, or worn by a
creature stuck in normal time, but you can affect any item that
is not in another creature's possession.
You are undetectable while time stop lasts. You cannot enter
an area protected by an antimagic field, or by protection from
chaos/evil/good/law, or by a magic circle spell, while under the
effects of time stop.
