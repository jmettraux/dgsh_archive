You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is
common in the area where the spell is cast---stone, timber, or
(at worst) sod. The floor is level, clean, and dry. In all
respects the lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy
door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace.
The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than
natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a
normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its
occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable
security otherwise---it is as strong as a normal stone
building, regardless of its material composition. The dwelling
resists flames and fire as if it were stone. It is impervious to
normal missiles (but not the sort cast by siege machinery or
giants).
The door, shutters, and even chimney are secure against
intrusion, the former two being arcane locked and the latter
secured by an iron grate at the top and a narrow flue. In
addition, these three areas are protected by an alarm spell.
Finally, an unseen servant is conjured to provide service to you
for the duration of the shelter.
The secure shelter contains rude furnishings---eight bunks,
a trestle table, eight stools, and a writing desk.
