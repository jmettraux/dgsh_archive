An immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere surrounds you
and excludes all spell effects of up to 3rd level. The area or
effect of any such spells does not include the area of the minor
globe of invulnerability. Such spells fail to affect any target
located within the globe. This includes spell-like abilities and
spells or spell-like effects from devices. However, any type of
spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of
4th level and higher are not affected by the globe. The globe can
be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell, but not by an
area dispel magic. You can leave and return to the globe without
penalty.
Note that spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects
enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not
dispelled. For example, creatures inside the globe would still
see a mirror image created by a caster outside the globe. If that
caster then entered the globe, the images would wink out, to
reappear when the caster exited the globe. Likewise, a caster
standing in the area of a light spell would still receive
sufficient light for vision, even though that part of the light
spell volume in the globe would not be luminous.
If a given spell has more than one level depending on which
character class is casting it, use the level appropriate to the
caster to determine whether minor globe of invulnerability stops
it.
