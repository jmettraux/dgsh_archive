A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors
captivates those within it. Rainbow pattern captivates a maximum
of 24 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected
first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to
the spell's point of origin are affected first. Affected
creatures who fail their saves are captivated by the pattern.
Captivated creatures cannot move away from the pattern, nor can
they take actions other than to defend themselves. Thus, a
captivated fighter cannot run away or attack but suffers no
penalties when attacked. An attack on a captivated creature frees
it from the spell immediately.
With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the
rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its
effective point of origin). All captivated creatures follow the
moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the
effect. Captivated creatures who are restrained and removed from
the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its
subjects into a dangerous area (through flame, off a cliff,
etc.), each captivated creature gets a second save. If the view
of the lights is completely blocked (by an obscuring mist spell,
for instance), creatures who can't see them are no longer
affected.
The spell does not affect sightless creatures.
