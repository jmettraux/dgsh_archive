   <string>If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this spell to hold them spellbound. To cast the spell, you must speak or sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected give you their undivided attention, ignoring their surroundings. They are considered to have an attitude of friendly while under the effect of the spell. Those of a race or religion unfriendly to yours have a +4 bonus to the saving throw.  Creatures with 4 or more HD or with Wisdom scores of 16 or higher remain aware of their surroundings and have an attitude of indifferent. They gain new saving throws if they witness actions that they oppose.

The enchantment lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those enthralled by your words take no action while you speak or sing, and for 1d3 rounds thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance must also successfully save or become enthralled.  The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or perform any action other than speaking or singing.

If those not enthralled have unfriendly or hostile attitudes toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end the spell. This check is based on the character with the highest Charisma and has a +2 bonus for each other jeerer who can make a Charisma check of 10 or higher. The heckling ends the spell if it beats your opposed Charisma check. Only one such challenge is allowed per use of the spell.

If any member of the audience is attacked (or subjected to an overtly hostile act), the spell ends and the audience becomes immediately unfriendly toward you (or hostile, for audience members with 4 or more HD and Wisdom 16 or higher).</string>
