   <string>Benefit: The character can create a wand of any spell of 4th level or
lower that the character knows. Crafting a wand takes 1 day for each
1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a wand is its caster
level multiplied by the spell level multiplied by 750 gp. To craft a
wand, the character must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use
up raw materials costing half of this base price.
A newly created wand has 50 charges.
Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP
cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the cost derived
from the base cost, the character must expend fifty copies of the
material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.</string>
