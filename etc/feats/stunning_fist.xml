   <string>Benefit: Declare that the character is using the feat before making an
attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). It forces
a foe damaged by the character's unarmed attack to make a Fortitude
saving throw (DC 10 + one-half the character's level + Wis modifier),
in addition to dealing damage normally. If the defender fails his
saving throw, he is stunned for 1 round (until just before the
character's next action). A stunned character can't act and loses any
Dexterity bonus to Armor Class. Attackers get a +2 bonus on attack
rolls against a stunned opponent. The character may attempt a stunning
attack once per day for every four levels attained, and no more than
once per round.</string>
