   <string>Benefit: When using the weapon the character selected, the character's threat range is doubled.
Special: The character can gain this feat multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time the character takes the feat, it applies to a new weapon.
Note: "Keen" magic weapons also double their normal, nonmagical threat range. As with all doubled doublings, the result is triple.</string>
