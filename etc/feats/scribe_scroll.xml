   <string>Benefit: The character can create a scroll of any spell that the character knows. Scribing a scroll takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scroll is its spell level multiplied by its caster level multiplied by 25 gp. To scribe a scroll, the character must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of this base price.  Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, the character must expend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.</string>
