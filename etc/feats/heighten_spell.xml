   <string>Benefit: A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up
to 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually
increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All
effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and ability
to penetrate a minor globe of invulnerability) are calculated
according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as
difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.</string>
