   <string>Benefit: The character gets a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against
attacks of opportunity caused when the character moves out of or
within a threatened area. Note: A condition that makes the character
lose the Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes the
character lose dodge bonuses. Also, dodge bonuses stack with each
other, unlike most types of bonuses.</string>
