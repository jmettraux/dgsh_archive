   <string>Benefit: The character ignores all penalties for using an off hand.
The character is neither left-handed nor right-handed.
Normal: Without this feat, a character who uses his or her off hand
suffers a -4 penalty to attack rolls, ability checks, and skill
checks. For example, a right-handed character wielding a weapon with
her left hand suffers a -4 penalty to attack rolls with that weapon.
Special: This feat helps offset the penalty for fighting with two
weapons.</string>
