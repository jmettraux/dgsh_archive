   <string>Benefit: The character must have at least one hand free (holding
nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when the character would
normally be hit with a ranged weapon, the character may make a Reflex
saving throw against a DC of 20 (if the ranged weapon has a magical
bonus to attack, the DC increases by that amount). If the character
succeeds, the character deflects the weapon. The character must be
aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a
ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons
can't be deflected.</string>
