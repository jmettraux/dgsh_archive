   <string>Benefit: The creature ignores all penalties for using an off hand.
Normal: Without this feat, a creature who uses an off hand suffers a
-4 penalty to attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks. A
creature has one primary hand, and all the others are off hands; for
example, a four-armed creature has one primary hand and three off
hands.
Special: This feat replaces the Ambidexterity feat for creatures with
more than two arms.</string>
